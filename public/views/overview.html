enrollment period. The program requires a $1,000 deposit to be submitted no less than 2 weeks before the
start of the program, if enrollment is on or prior to May 15, 2017. If enrollment is after May 15, 2017, the
full amount of tuition including the deposit must be paid by the first day of the program (June 5, 2017).
Since all software used during the program is open source, there are no additional fees for the use of
software within the core curriculum.
If the student withdraws from the program before June 5, 2017, the student shall forfeit the deposit amount
($1,000). If the student withdraws after June 5, 2017, or fails to complete the program, the student shall forfeit the full tuition cost. Because there are no pre-requisites for this non-degree-seeking program, no
credit shall be granted for any previous courses, training, or education completed.</p><i class="fa fa-cog fa-5x"></i></div>
